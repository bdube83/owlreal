This is the application break down.
Screengrap is a media sharing social website that allows users to share images/videos. The founder stated that the vision was to broadcast and store different media publicly or privately on the internet.
The website is still in beta version and was developed on 12 Feb 2016. During the first two days after it was published, it received 100 hits and 6 sign-ups. This resulted in a need for a bigger server to control the web traffic. The company plans to buy an Amazon web space to cater for the ever increasing market.
The app is currently hosted in a free online development platform that provides an https protocol i.e. a secure web host and code workspace used for software updates.
Due to a lack of funding the website only caters photo media, but once funding becomes available the company plans to include video media.
